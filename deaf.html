		<h1>Deaf Community</h1>
<p>
	Learning and teaching ASL will connect hearing
people to the Deaf community. ASL is a very important
communication tool for Deaf people and
learning even basic ASL will allow for an accessible
environment. From the article,<a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/how-social-media-became-a-game-changer-for-the-deaf-community/514223/"> “How social
media became a game-changer for the Deaf community”,<a>
Ryan Commerson a 41 year old media
strategist for Communication Service for the Deaf
said “While growing up, it was made clear from
the beginning that I would not be accepted as an
equal – condescending attitude from teachers,
perplexing stares from retail employees, and my
peers making fun of my sign language during recess,”.
By teaching more people sign language
and learning about the Deaf culture it develops
awareness and sensitivity to the Deaf community.

	<h2>Communcation</h2>
<p>
	According the <a href="https://www.healthyhearing.com/report/52285-The-importance-of-deaf-culture">Rochester Institute of Technology,</a>
one of Americas premiere learning institutions for
the Deaf, there are five guidelines to remember
when communicating with the Deaf.
<ol>1. Acknowledge the fact that your first attempts
to communicate will feel awkward and uncomfortable.
This will pass as your interaction progresses.</ol>
<ol>2. It’s OK to use paper and pen. In fact, the Deaf
person will appreciate your efforts even more if
you use a combination of communication methods,
such as hand gestures, facial expressions
and the written word.</ol>
<ol>3. Take the time to communicate and connect.
Deaf people consider communication an investment
of time and effort. Slow down, take your
time and ask for clarification if you need it.</ol>
<ol>4. Understand that Deaf people listen with their
eyes. Vision is the most useful tool they have to
communicate and receive information. For this
reason, only speak when you have eye contact,
even if they are using an interpreter. Maintaining
eye contact is a sign of respect.</ol>
<ol>5. Use the beginning and ending of a conversation
as an opportunity to make physical and
visual contact with the Deaf person, especially if
they have been using an interpreter during your
conversation. Smile, shake hands, touch their
arm (if appropriate) and make eye contact.</ol>
</p>
<h2>Deaf Culture</h2>
<p>Throughout the years there have been many terms referring to Deaf people. Some offensive names that are not acceptable are “deaf and dumb”
	and “deaf mute”. The terms like “hearing impaired”, “deaf and hard of hearing” or “people with hearing loss” which are used by public institutions,
	political groups and individuals are an attempt to be inclusive. To the Deaf community, these terms focus on what is perceived as lacking or lost.
	The term “Deaf” with a capital “D” is an inclusive term because it focuses on what people have, such as a living culture,an available language and the infinite
	possibilities that being Deaf can offer.
</p>
<h2>ASL history</h2>
<p>There is not one true origin of ASL, but, rather, a combination of stories. There is evidence that in the 1600s inhabitants of Martha's Vineyard off Cape Cod had
	a genetic pool which caused a large deaf community. They adapted by creating a visual language to communicate. Similarly, the indigenous had members of the village
	who were Deaf. These sign languages were brought together into the first school for the Deaf in Hartford, Connecticut which was founded in 1817.
Another major influence on ASL was French sign language. The founders of the Deaf school was Laurent Clerc, a deaf teacher from France and Thomas Gallaudet, a hearing
American minister. Together the French sign language and various indigenous signs were combined and created ASL that we use today.
Gallaudet University was founded in 1864 with a charter signed by Abraham Lincoln.<a href="https://www.gallaudet.edu/about/who-we-are">From the Gallaudet University website,
	“our country created a beacon in the world
for visual learning, visual language, social justice and full rights for deaf and hard-of-hearing people. This singular act recognized the importance of higher education
to advance the lives and opportunities of deaf and hard-of-hearing people.” The creation of Gallaudet University created larger communities for the Deaf.
Although Gallaudet brought the Deaf community together, pivotal moment in ASL happened in 1880 which impacted the widespread acceptance of Deaf people.
At the international congress on the education of the Deaf Conference in Milan Italy, educators who supported a bill in which oral instruction for Deaf students successfully
blocked the influence of educators supporting Sign Language. The congress voted in favour for oral education for all Deaf children. In the span of 40 years after the conference,
the percentage of Deaf children being taught by the oral method went from very small to 80%. Before this bill was passed, there was 45% of Deaf teachers who were Deaf, but after
there was only 11%. This approach to teaching became mainstream for the next century and a half, which misplaced societies belief that spoken word is better than sign language.
In the 1960s, linguists at Gallaudet University proved that ASL is a fully developed independent language separate from English. Since then there has been positive view on ASL
and the Deaf culture as a whole.
