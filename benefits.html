		<h1>Other Benefits</h1>
		<h2>Benefits for children</h2>
		<h3>Higher Reading Level</h3>
<p>
	A 10-year research was conducted by Marilyn Daniels from Pennsylvania University. She looked into preschool and kindergarten-aged kids who were taught ASL.
	Over 10 years she came to the conclusion that the kids who learned ASL always had a higher reading level and a 15–20% improvement in vocabulary.
	From Daniels,<a href="https://aslblog.goreact.com/2017/07/03/4-scientific-reasons-why-everyone-should-learn-asl/">“[ASL] helps children in terms of giving a picture for the words. Most of the signs are iconic, so since the signs look like what the words are,
	it helps the child remember what the word is. Since the child can associate the letters in a word with a sign, they are more easily able to remember it.”</a>
	</p>
<h3>Long term benefits</h3>
<p>
	Over the course of a 20-year long study, it has been determined that learning ASL as a baby is linked to having a higher IQ.
	They also discovered that it leads to heightened reasoning skills.
Dr. Linda P. Acredolo and Dr. Susan W. Goodwyn conducted this study and found that the babies were speaking much sooner than the non-ASL
babies and they were using more complex sentences.<a href="https://aslblog.goreact.com/2017/07/03/4-scientific-reasons-why-everyone-should-learn-asl/">It was also discovered that the ASL- learning babies had an average of 12 points higher on IQ tests.</a>
</p>
<h3>Helps Babies Communicate</h3>
<p>
	According to the American sign language university,
babies even as young as eight months old
can sign words and imitate signs from their parents.
Having this way to communicate early allows
for less frustration if the child is hungry, thirsty or
in pain.<a href="https://aslblog.goreact.com/2017/07/03/4-scientific-reasons-why-everyone-should-learn-asl/">This also allows parents and children to
bond and create trust within the relationship.</a>
</p>
<h3>Elementary Schools</h3>
<p>
	With all the research on the benefits of teaching
kids ASL, I believe it should be taught in elementary
schools. ASL should be taught as a second
language similar to how we teach French. Teaching
children ASL will improve their fine motor
skills, accelerate their speech development, and
help them remember words since muscle memory
is involved. ASL also brings more senses into the
learning experience which makes it more enjoyable
and memorable.<a href="https://www.speechbuddy.com/blog/language-development/5-ways-sign-language-benefits-the-hearing/">Not only does learning ASL
improve many factors in a child's life but it connects
them to the Deaf community as well as people
with various disabilities who may not be able
to communicate verbally.</a>
</p>
<h2>Benefits for people with disabilies</h2>
<p>
Studies have shown an improvement on children
with disabilities when they learn ASL.<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/26234583">Anne Toth
did a 10-year study</a> on children who had been
diagnosed with autism, down syndrome, fetal
alcohol syndrome and other learning disabilities.
She used sign language to try and improve their
communication.
The children were exposed to ASL through parents,
teachers and a DVD from Toth, which outlined
simple ASL words, letters and numbers. The
findings of this research showed that the children
overall did show improvement in communication
and were able to recognize signs and respond
appropriately. The experiment worked so well
that all the families and people surrounding the
children also wanted to learn ASL. One story from
the experiment included a 4-year-old who was
diagnosed with down syndrome. Her parents
applied for this because she was showing sings of
wanting to communicate, but not being able to
verbally get her thoughts across.<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/26234583">After 6 months in
the program she could imitate all the signs as well
as speak the words and, read and sign the words
before the video clip played.</a>
Overall this was a success and greatly improved
the lives of children with disabilities and their families
